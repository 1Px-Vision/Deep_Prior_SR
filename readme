Single-pixel imaging (SPI) has become an innovative approach for computational imaging, particularly beneficial in environments where traditional imaging systems fall short. SPI shines in low light conditions and 
without high-quality cameras for specific spectral ranges. It uses structured light to convert one-dimensional signals into detailed two- and three-dimensional images. The fidelity of SPI-generated images 
largely depends on the amount of temporal measurements taken. Deep learning enhances the reconstruction of SPI images but needs more training data, especially for specific spectral bands. In our study, we introduce a novel  method that integrates the Deep Image Prior technique with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve SPI image quality in the near-infrared (NIR)
spectrum  (850 to 1550 nm). This approach bypasses the need for extensive SPI image datasets by adopting an unsupervised method for image super-resolution rooted in Deep Image Prior.  We assess different neural 
network models, including UNet and GAN frameworks, to gauge their performance in enhancing SPI-based computational vision systems.
